# DP9 VCO pre-layout estimates vs post-layout results
While the main focus should be on post-layout results, as those are the numbers that will more accurately reflect silicon performance, this section shows a comparison between the estimates from pre-layout simulations with back-annotated parasitic caps and post-layout results after implementing the updated and optimized layout for the optimized VCO design "DP9".


DP9 VCO schematic simulations, pre-layout estimates with annotated parasitic cap estimates from preliminary layout:
---
This is the estimated performance of the optimized VCO design "DP9" from Schematic (pre-layout) simulation with annotated parasitic caps on ring vco critical nets, estimated after preliminary layout extraction.

DP9 VCO schematic Vs PEX (pre-layout with annotated parasitic cap vs post-layout):
---
This plot shows the relatively good correlation between schematic (pre-layout) and PEX (post-layout) simulations after the full layout was implemented for VCO "DP9" which is the updated design with circuit changes and optimized layout.
